### Prerequisites

##### Downloads


* [**Arduino**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

##### Mac OS X

* Open "**Finder**" (Press &#8984;+ Space ) 
* type in "terminal" and open it
* type "cd Documents/Arduino/libraries"
* type "git clone https://github.com/nasys/badgerboard"
* Now when you open up your Arduino _Badgerboard_ library should appear under **Sketch -> Include library**

NB! with this installation you can use"git pull" to get the latest version of the library

##### Windows

#### manual
* Download this library as **.zip** file
* Open Arduino and include it under **Sketch -> Include library -> add .zip library**
* Open **Files -> Examples -> badger -> LoRa_temp_hum**

### **Badgerboard setup**
#### Test out your Badgerboard

* connect Badgerboard to your PC 
* Open Arduino
* Open Blink example **Files -> Examples -> Basic -> Blink**
* Change the time(number in milliseconds) inside the brackets after "**delay**" to change the speed of blinking
* To upload click on the right pointing arrow on the top-left corner of your Arduino window

In case all of this works then you have successfully uploaded your first program to Badgerboard


#### LoRa sensor setup

* Open **File -> Examples -> Badger -> LoRa_temp_hum**
* Replace examples **_devEUI_**[that came with badgerboard(16 hex char)], **_appEUI_**(16 hex char) and **_appKey_**(32 hex char) with the ones that Your LoRaWANâ„¢ solution provider has assigned.  
* Upload Your code to Badgerboard

In Arduino code your **_devEUI_**, **_appEUI_** and **_appKey_**
should look similar to this example: 

	const uint8_t devEUI[8] = {
	0x11, 0x11, 0x22, 0x22,
	0x33, 0x33, 0x44, 0x44
	};

	const uint8_t appKey[16] = {
	0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11,
	0x11, 0x11, 0x22, 0x22,
	0x22, 0x22, 0x22, 0x22,
	0x33, 0x33, 0x33, 0x33
	};

	const uint8_t appEUI[8] = {
	0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44,
	0x55, 0x66, 0x77, 0x88
	};
#### Known issues

* Works only with Arduino version 1.6.10 and later

### Version log

#### Version 0.0.2
:calendar:06.12.2016

	* Changed spreading factor changing to automatic
	* Added liquid detection example 

#### Version 0.0.1
:calendar:01.11.2016 

	Initial version of Badgerboard library

 

	
#### Used libraries
