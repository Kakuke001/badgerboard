1. Library setup:
	* Download this library as **_.zip _**
	* Open Arduino and include it under **_sketch -> include library -> add .zip library_**
	* Open **_files -> examples -> badger -> LoRa_temp_hum_**

2. LoRa sensor setup :

	* Replace example **_devEUI appEUI_** and **_appKey_** with the ones that Your LoRaWANâ„¢ solution provider has assigned.  
	* Upload Your code to Badgerboard

3. Known issues:

	* Works only with Arduino version 1.6.10 and later

Version 0.0.1

	* initial version of Badgerboard library
